quotes:
  - |
    They fuck you up, your mum and dad.
    They may not mean to, but they do.
    They fill you with the faults they had
    And add some extra, just for you. - Philip Larkin, “This Be the Verse”
  - |
    Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
    I took the one less traveled by,
    And that has made all the difference. - Robert Frost, “The Road Not Taken”
  - |
    Because I could not stop for Death –
    He kindly stopped for me –
    The Carriage held but just Ourselves –
    And Immortality. - Emily Dickinson, “Because I could not stop for Death – (479)”
  - |
    I celebrate myself, and sing myself,
    And what I assume you shall assume,
    For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you. - Walt Whitman, “Song of Myself”
  - |
    To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether ’tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them. To die: to sleep…” - William Shakespeare, Hamlet
  - |
    All the world’s a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players:
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts. - William Shakespeare, As You Like It
  - |
    Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
    Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
    And summer’s lease hath all too short a date - William Shakespeare, Sonnet 18
